# Cooper-Union-Writing-Center-Helper

A very simple dirty script to help you get a spot. I used itchat to send notification through wechat at the first moment that there is a open spot. 

A couple of dependencies can all be installed with pip install 'packageName'.

In line 30, the string refers to a specific semester (ex: Fall 2018). So it needs to be updated by user.

There are bots for other things like email, which can replace itchat in my code.
